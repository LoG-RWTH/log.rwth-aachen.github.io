>UPDATE: This position has been filled.

The Learning on Graph group in the CS Department of RWTH University is looking for a highly motivated student with practical experience in software engineering. The goal is to further improve an existing and already widely used open-source library in the area of graph learning by

* adding rigorous unit- and integration testing,
* adding detailed documentation in the form of auto-generated docs,
* developing a consistent API and refactoring existing code to improve readability and extensibility,
* setting up a feasible continuous delivery pipeline as well as a strategy with versioning and release.

This project provides an excellent opportunity to ambitious students in working on a large and popular open-source library and to have great impact on a rapidly growing field of machine learning.
