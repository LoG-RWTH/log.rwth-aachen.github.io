	At the Learning on Graphs group, led by <a href='https://chrsmrrs.github.io/'>Christopher Morris</a> at the Chair of Machine Learning and Reasoning at RWTH Aachen University, we are developing theoretical and practical approaches to machine learning on graphs. Machine learning on graphs is a relatively new field in machine learning that develops methods that automatically make predictions about graph properties. Our work is characterized by examining practical methods in terms of their theoretical properties.

	Machine learning on graphs is a relatively new field in machine learning that focuses on the structure of data and develops machine learning methods that automatically make predictions about the properties of graphs. 
	Our work is characterized by examining practical methods in terms of their theoretical properties.

	We are happy to work with interested and dedicated students on these problems. Refer to this <a href="../teaching/thesis.md">thesis guidlines</a> for further information.
